EchoDay is a web app centered around daily reflection, where each day feels like an echo. Whatever you add - notes, memories, or thoughts - comes back to you later, helping you revisit and reflect on moments that matter.

### Features

It features a set of handy widgets - one place to store them all.

- A Calendar to plan your schedule
- Notes for jotting down ideas
- An About My Day section to reflect on your day
- Todos list to stay on top of tasks
- Reminders, so you never miss anything
- Memories, where you store cherished images

Oh, it also has a little mood tracker with some fun emojis and moods to choose from :)
